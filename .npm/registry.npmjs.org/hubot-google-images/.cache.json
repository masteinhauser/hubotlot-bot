hubot-google-images\n\nA hubot script that interacts with the Google Images API for greater productivity and lulz.\n\nSee [`src/google-images.coffee`](src/google-images.coffee) for full documentation.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn hubot project repo, run:\n\n`npm install hubot-google-images --save`\n\nThen add **hubot-google-images** to your `external-scripts.json`:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"hubot-google-images\"\n]\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Custom Search Engine\nSet environment variables `HUBOT_GOOGLE_CSE_ID` and `HUBOT_GOOGLE_CSE_KEY`\nto use the [Google Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/overview)\ninstead of the deprecated image search API.\n\nYou might want to use the custom search API if you have concerns about\nseeing NSFW images. The old Google image search API only has `safe=active`\nwhich is not as strict as `safe=strict` on the new API.\n\n### Custom Mustachification Service\n\nIf you want to run you own instance instead of the default [mustachify](http://mustachify.me/), you can add `HUBOT_MUSTACHIFY_URL` to your environment variables and provide your own url. More info and the source code of mustachify can be found at [https://github.com/afeld/mustachio](https://github.com/afeld/mustachio)\n\n## Sample Interaction\n\n```\nuser1>> hubot image me bananas\nhubot>> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Bananas.jpg\nuser2>> hubot animate me it's happening\nhubot>> http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--8U6TKXoi--/thfydh8egnt8he5esoz8.gif\nuser3>> hubot mustache me family portrait\nhubot>> http://mustachify.me/1?src=http://www.daviddanielsphotography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Chowen-Family-Portraits-east-of-Park-City-13.jpg\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"technicalpickles","email":"josh@technicalpickles.com"},{"name":"michaelansel","email":"npm@anselcomputers.com"},{"name":"louim","email":"couture.lm@gmail.com"},{"name":"haroldputman","email":"hputman@lexmark.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-06-09T02:04:00.943Z","created":"2014-08-25T14:22:04.260Z","0.1.0":"2014-08-25T14:22:04.260Z","0.1.1":"2014-11-25T16:00:01.383Z","0.1.2":"2014-12-15T19:53:18.246Z","0.1.3":"2015-02-11T20:37:02.580Z","0.1.4":"2015-03-06T23:36:37.408Z","0.2.0":"2015-06-06T00:36:59.784Z","0.1.5":"2015-06-06T01:44:49.963Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-google-images#readme","keywords":["hubot","hubot-scripts"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-google-images.git"},"author":{"name":"Josh Nichols","email":"technicalpickles@github.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-google-images/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"D911Y51AKXIDJKPDB2Z7PNF99\""}
